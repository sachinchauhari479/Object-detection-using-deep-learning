# Object-detection-using-deep-learning
# Introduction
Object detection is a critical task in computer vision applications. It is the task of detection objects from different object categories such as human, animal, tree, birds,etc which is listed in coco.name.

Built software to detect the object of living and non-living objects. It detects the object and shows the name of the object. we use the YOLO algorithm to identify the object
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a method / way to do object detection. It is the algorithm /strategy behind how the code is going to detect objects in the image. The official implementation of this idea is available through DarkNet.
